# DockerOCR-DDDDocr
DockerOCR is a lightweight Flask application that processes base64-encoded images, applies image thresholding, and uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text. The app includes retry logic with adjustable image processing parameters to improve recognition accuracy, making it ideal for handling noisy or distorted images.
